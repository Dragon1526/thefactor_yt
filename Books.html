<<H2> The Brief History Of Time </h2>
<FONT COLOR="blue">A Brief History of Time:<FONT COLOR="white"> From the Big Bang to Black Holes is a book on theoretical 
cosmology by English physicist Stephen Hawking. It was first published in 1988.
 Hawking wrote the book for readers who had no prior knowledge of physics.
In A Brief History of Time, Hawking writes in non-technical terms about the structure, origin,
 development and eventual fate of the Universe, which is the object of study of astronomy and modern physics. 
He talks about basic concepts like space and time, basic building blocks that make up the 
Universe (such as quarks) and the fundamental forces that govern it (such as gravity).
He writes about cosmological phenomena such as the Big Bang and black holes. He discusses 
two major theories, general relativity and quantum mechanics, that modern scientists use to describe the Universe.
Finally, he talks about the search for a unifying theory that describes everything 
in the Universe in a coherent manner.

<br>
<FONT COLOR="blue"><strong> Conclusion </strong>
<br>
<FONT COLOR="white">In this final chapter, Hawking summarises the efforts made by humans through their history to
understand the Universe and their place in it: starting from the belief in anthropomorphic spirits 
controlling nature, followed by the recognition of regular patterns in nature, and finally with the 
scientific advancement in recent centuries, the inner workings of the universe have become far better understood. 
He recalls the suggestion of the nineteenth-century French mathematician Laplace that the Universe's structure and 
evolution could eventually be precisely explained by a set of laws whose origin is left in God's domain. 
However, Hawking states that the uncertainty principle introduced by the quantum theory in the twentieth 
century has set limits to the predictive accuracy of future laws to be discovered.

Hawking comments that historically, the study of cosmology (the study of the origin, 
evolution, and end of Earth and the Universe as a whole) has been primarily motivated by a 
search for philosophical and religious insights, for instance, to better understand the 
nature of God, or even whether God exists at all. However, for Hawking, 
most scientists today who work on these theories approach them with mathematical 
calculation and empirical observation, rather than asking such philosophical questions. 
In his mind, the increasingly technical nature of these theories have caused modern 
cosmology to become increasingly divorced from philosophical discussion. Hawking 
nonetheless expresses hope that one day everybody would talk about these theories in 
order to understand the true origin and nature of the Universe, and accomplish "the ultimate triumph of human reasoning".

<H2><FONT COLOR="Black"><strong>Relativity: The Special and the General Theory </strong></h2>
<FONT COLOR="blue"><strong>Relativity:General relativity</strong><FONT COLOR="white">
<br> 
Also known as the general theory of 
relativity and Einstein's theory of gravity, is the geometric theory of 
gravitation published by Albert Einstein in 1915 and is the current description 
of gravitation in modern physics. General relativity generalizes special 
relativity and refines Newton's law of universal gravitation, providing a 
unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time or 
four-dimensional spacetime. In particular, the curvature of spacetime is 
directly related to the energy and momentum of whatever matter and radiation 
are present. The relation is specified by the Einstein field equations, a system of second order partial differential equations.

Newton's law of universal gravitation, which describes classical 
gravity, can be seen as a prediction of general relativity for the 
almost flat spacetime geometry around stationary mass distributions. 
Some predictions of general relativity, however, are beyond Newton's 
law of universal gravitation in classical physics. These predictions 
concern the passage of time, the geometry of space, the motion of bodies 
in free fall, and the propagation of light, and include gravitational time dilation, 
gravitational lensing, the gravitational redshift of light, the Shapiro time delay and 
singularities/black holes. So far, all tests of general relativity have been shown to be in 
agreement with the theory. The time dependent solutions of general relativity enable us to 
talk about the history of the universe and have provided the modern framework for cosmology, 
thus leading to the discovery of the Big Bang and cosmic microwave background radiation.

Special relativity was originally proposed by Albert Einstein
in a paper published on 26 September 1905 titled "On the Electrodynamics 
of Moving Bodies".[p 1] The incompatibility of Newtonian mechanics with Maxwell's 
equations of electromagnetism and, experimentally, the Michelson–Morley null 
(and subsequent similar experiments) demonstrated that the historically hypothesized 
luminiferous aether did not exist. This led to Einstein's development of special relativity, 
which corrects mechanics to handle situations involving all motions and especially those at a 
speed close to that of light (known as relativistic velocities). Today, special relativity 
is proven to be the most accurate model of motion at any speed when gravitational and 
quantum effects are negligible.[3][4] Even so, the Newtonian model is still valid as 
a simple and accurate approximation at low velocities (relative to the speed of light), for example, everyday motions on Earth.

Special relativity has a wide range of consequences that have been experimentally verified.[5] They include the relativity of simultaneity, length contraction, time dilation, the relativistic velocity addition formula, the relativistic Doppler effect, relativistic mass, a universal speed limit, mass–energy equivalence, the speed of causality and the Thomas precession.[1][2] It has, for example, replaced the conventional notion of an absolute universal time with the notion of a time that is dependent on reference frame and spatial position. Rather than an invariant time interval between two events, there is an invariant spacetime interval. Combined with other laws of physics, the two postulates of special relativity predict the equivalence of mass and energy, as expressed in the mass–energy equivalence formula

c is the speed of light in vacuum. It also explains how the phenomena of electricity and magnetism are related.

general scientific and philosophical point of view, are interested in the theory,
